# Important
If you want the projects to work you will have to use .net 6.0. Then open the game with melonloader at least once then go to Viewfinder\MelonLoader\Dependencies\Il2CppAssemblyGenerator\UnityDependencies and add every file as a reference in Visual Studio. 
Go to Viewfinder\MelonLoader\net6 and add MelonLoader.dll and 0Harmony.dll as a reference. Go to Viewfinder\MelonLoader\Il2CppAssemblies and add Assembly-CSharp.dll as a reference.

When you build solution you can find the mod dll you have to add to the mods folder in ProjectName\bin\Debug\net6.0 and then its named ProjectName.dll.

You can use these files for making your own mods or if you just want to look at the projects.

.NET 6.0: https://dotnet.microsoft.com/en-us/download/dotnet/6.0
